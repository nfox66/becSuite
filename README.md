Ground State Codes and Bogoliubov Codes for Spin One and Spin Two Condensates.

The code is split into two folders: Spin one code and spin two code. Within each of these folders are helper files for running ground state systems with Bogoliubov excitations on top of these. These helper files are called interactiveGroundState.py and interactiveBogoliubov.py.

More details on how to run this code and how the code is setup and works can be found in my thesis. Link to follow shortly.
